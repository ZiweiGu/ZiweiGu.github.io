I"a<p>I loved every bit of my 2+ years of research experience at Cornell. I was also grateful for the opportunity to participate in top conferences including WWW’21, CHI’20, and CHI’21. Overall, the experiences are life-changing, and I’d like to summarize some of my learnings here (constantly updating) as a reference to others and to myself.</p>
