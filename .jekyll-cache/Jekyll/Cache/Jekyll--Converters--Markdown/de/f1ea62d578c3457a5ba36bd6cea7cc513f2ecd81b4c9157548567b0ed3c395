I"Å<p>Definitions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>null space</strong> of T: null T = {v ‚àà V: Tv = 0} (stuff in the original vector space that‚Äôs mapped to 0 by T)</li>
  <li><strong>range</strong> of T: range T = {Tv: v ‚àà V} (all the resulting vectors after the mapping T)</li>
  <li>A function T: V -&gt; W is <strong>injective</strong> if Tu = Tv implies u = v.</li>
  <li>A function T: V -&gt; W is <strong>surjective</strong> if its range equals W.</li>
  <li>An <strong>isomorphism</strong> is an invertible (injective + surjective) linear map.</li>
  <li>Two vector spaces are isomorphic if there is an isomorphism from one vector space onto the other one.</li>
</ul>

<p>Facts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A linear map is injective iff null T = {0}.
<span style="color:gray">[Proof Idea: if v ‚àà null T then T(v) = 0 = T(0) =&gt; v = 0 so null T ‚äÜ {0}; other direction trivial.]</span></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rank-Nullity: if T ‚àà L(V, W) then dim V = dim null T + dim range T</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A map to a smaller dimensional space is not injective. (‚Äúsmaller‚Äù as measured by <em>dimension</em>)
<span style="color:gray">[Proof Idea: using Rank-Nullity]</span></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A map to a larger dimensional space is not surjective.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If T is invertible, it‚Äôs inverse is unique.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two finite-dimensional vector spaces over F are isomorphic if and only if they have the same dimension. 
<span style="color:gray">[Proof Idea: consider T: V -&gt; W; =&gt;: using Rank-Nullity; &lt;=: denote basis of V, W. Apply T to the linear combination of the basis of V, which results in the same linear combination of the basis of W, we can show T is surjective and injective, and is thus invertible.]</span></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>L(V, W) and F<sup>m,n</sup> are isomorphic</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>dim F<sup>m,n</sup> = mn 
<span style="color:gray">[Proof Idea: m-by-n matrices that have 0 in all entries except for a 1 in one entry form a basis of F<sup>m,n</sup>. How many of them are there?]</span></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Based on the previous two facts, dim L(V, W) = (dim V)(dim W)</p>
  </li>
</ul>
