summary: Cool facts about eigenvalues - the most important topic in linear algebra
---

First, some clarifications. We are considering linear maps from a finite-dimensional vector space to itself (also called an **operator**), as opposed to linear maps from one vector space to another vector space. 

Suppose _V_ is a finite-dimensional vector space, _T_ &isin; _L_(_V_), and &lambda; &isin; _F_. 

Some definitions to know:
- Invariant subspace: U is invariant under T if T|<sub>U</sub> is an operator on U.

- &lambda; &isin; _F_  is an eigenvalue of T if &exist; v &isin; V s.t. v &â€Œ#8800; 0 and Tv = &lambda;v.
