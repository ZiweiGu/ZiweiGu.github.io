Can machine learning play a role in the creative process? Do computers have an advantage in generating more complex sequences? How to strike a balance between novelty and rules/patterns in AI systems? This project explores these questions and generates piano music with long-term coherence, creating more than 8 consistent phrases (around 40s) out of the given motif.
